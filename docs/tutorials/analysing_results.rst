Analysing results
=================

End results
-----------

In the :ref:`first tutorial<tutorials_getting_started>` you solved a very
simple DCOP using the following command::

  pydcop solve --algo dpop graph_coloring.yaml

This command outputs many results, given in json so that you can parse then
easily, for example when writing more complex scripts for
experimentation.
You can also get these results directly in a file using the ``--output`` global
option (see. :ref:`pyDcop cli dcoumentation<usage_cli_ref_options>`):
``pydcop --output results.json solve --algo dpop graph_coloring.yaml``

You may have noticed that, even though the DCOP has only 3 variables and a
handful of constraints, the results is quite long and contains a lot of
information.

At the top level you can find global results, which apply to the DCOP as a
whole::

    {
      "agt_metrics": {
        // metrics for each agent, see bellow
      },
      "assignment": {
        "v1": "R",
        "v2": "G",
        "v3": "R"
      },
      "cost": -0.1,
      "cycle": 1,
      "msg_count": 29,
      "msg_size": 8,
      "status": "FINISHED",
      "time": 0.006329163996269926,
      "violation": 0
    }

* ``status``: indicates how the command was stopped, can be one of

  * ``FINISHED``, when all computation finished,
  * ``TIMEOUT``, when the command was interrupted because it reached timeout
    set with the ``--timeout`` option,
  * ``STOPPED``, when the command was interrupted with ``CTRL+C``.

* ``assignement``: contains the assignment that was found by the DCOP
  algorithm.
* ``cost``: the cost for this assignment (i.e. the sum of the cost of all
  constraints in the DCOP).
* ``violation``: the number of violated hard constraints, when using DCOP with a
  mix of soft and hard constraints (hard constraints support is still in
  experimental stage and not documented).
* ``msg_size``: the total size of messages exchanged between agents.
* ``msg_count``: the number of messages exchanged between agents.
* ``time``: the elapsed time, in second
* ``cycles``, the number of cycles for  DCOP computations.
  In this example it is always 0 has DPOP has no notion of cycle.


The ``agt_metrics`` section contains one entry for each of the agents in the
DCOP. Each of these entries contains several items::

    "a1": {
      "activity_ratio": 0.24987247830102727,
      "count_ext_msg": {
        "v2": 2
      },
      "cycles": {
        "v2": 0
      },
      "size_ext_msg": {
        "v2": 4
      }
    },


* ``count_ext_msg`` and ``size_ext_msg``, which contain count and size of
  messages sent and received by each DCOP computations hosted on this agent
* ``cycles``, the number of cycles for each DCOP computation hosted on this
  agent.
  In this example it is always 0 has DPOP has no notion of cycle.
* ``activity_ratio``, the ratio of *active time* on total elapsed time,
   where active time is defined as the time the agent spent handling a
   message (as opposed to waiting for messages).


Logs
----

By default, the :ref:`solve<pydcop_commands_solve>` command (like all other
pyDCOP commands) only outputs teh results (here, the end metrics).
You can enable  logs by adding the ``-v``
:ref:`global option<usage_cli_ref_options>` with the requested level::

  pydcop -v 2 solve --algo dpop graph_coloring.yaml

Level 1 displays only warnings messages, level 2 displays warnings and info
messages and level 3 all messages (and can be quite verbose! )

For more control over logs, you can use the ``--log <conf_file>``
:ref:`option<usage_cli_ref_options>`, where ``conf_file`` is a
`standard python log configuration file<https://docs
.python.org/3/library/logging.config.html#configuration-file-format>`::

  pydcop --log algo_logs.conf solve --algo dpop graph_coloring.yaml

For example, using :download:`this long configuration file<algo_logs.conf>`,
all logs from DPOP computations will be logged in a ``agents.log`` file,
without any log from the pyDCOP infrastructure
(discovery, messaging, etc.).
This can be very useful to analyse an algorithm's behavior.
When solving our graph coloring problem with DPOP, you should get a log
containing something similar to this::


  pydcop.algo.dpop.v3 -  Leaf v3 prepares init message v3 -> v2
  pydcop.algo.dpop.v2 -  Util message from v3 : NAryMatrixRelation(None,
 ['v2'], [-0.1  0.1])
  pydcop.algo.dpop.v2 -  On UTIL message from v3, send UTILS msg to parent
  ['v3']
  pydcop.algo.dpop.v1 -  Util message from v2 : NAryMatrixRelation(None,
 ['v1'], [0. 0.])
  pydcop.algo.dpop.v1 -  ROOT: On UNTIL message from v2, send value msg to
 childrens ['v2']
  pydcop.algo.dpop.v1 -  Selecting new value: R, -0.1 (previous: None, None)
  pydcop.algo.dpop.v1 -  Value selected at v1 : R - -0.1
  pydcop.algo.dpop.v2 -  v2: on value message from v1 : "DpopMessage(VALUE,
 ([Variable(v1, None, VariableDomain(colors))], ['R']))"
  pydcop.algo.dpop.v2 -  Slicing relation on {'v1': 'R'}
  pydcop.algo.dpop.v2 -  Relation after slicing NAryMatrixRelation
 (joined_utils, ['v2'])
  pydcop.algo.dpop.v2 -  Selecting new value: G, 0.0 (previous: None, None)
  pydcop.algo.dpop.v2 -  Value selected at v2 : G - 0.0
  pydcop.algo.dpop.v3 -  v3: on value message from v2 : "DpopMessage(VALUE,
 ([Variable(v2, None, VariableDomain(colors))], ['G']))"
  pydcop.algo.dpop.v3 -  Slicing relation on {'v2': 'G'}
  pydcop.algo.dpop.v3 -  Relation after slicing NAryMatrixRelation
 (joined_utils, ['v3'])
  pydcop.algo.dpop.v3 -  Selecting new value: R, 0.1 (previous: None, None)
  pydcop.algo.dpop.v3 -  Value selected at v3 : R - 0.1


Run-time metrics
----------------

The output of the :ref:`solve<pydcop_commands_solve>` command only gives you the
end results of the command, but sometime you need to know what happens during
the execution of the DCOP algorithm.



Plotting the results
--------------------

matplot lib example.
