NCBB: No-Commitment Branch and Bound
------------------------------------

NCBB is a polynomial-space search for DCOP proposed by Chechetka and Sycara in 2006
:cite:`chechetka_no-commitment_2006`.
It is a branch and bound search algorithm with modifications for efficiency, it runs
concurrent search process in different partitions of the search phase.

NCBB defines one computation for each varaible in the DCOP and,
like DPOP, runs on a pseudo-tree, which is automatically built when using the
:ref:`solve<pydcop_commands_solve>` command.

In the current implementation, which maps the original article
:cite:`chechetka_no-commitment_2006` ,
only binary constraints are supported.
According to the authors, it could be extended to n-ary constraints.

NCBB is a synchronous algorithm and is composed of two phases:
* a initialization phase, during which a global upper bound is computed
* a search phase
